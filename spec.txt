I want to set up a file operations class for interaction with the dropbox api via the python dropbox library. The class should have the following methods:

1. **upload**: Uploads a files/folders to a specified path in Dropbox.
2. **download**: Downloads a files/folders from a specified path in Dropbox.
3. **delete**: Deletes a files/folders from a specified path in Dropbox.
4. **list**: Lists all files in a specified folder in Dropbox.
5. **create_folder**: Creates a folder in a specified path in Dropbox.
7. **move*: Moves a file from one path to another in Dropbox.
8. **copy**: Copies a file from one path to another in Dropbox.
9. **rename: Renames a file/folder in Dropbox.
10. **search**: Searches for a file/folder in Dropbox (optionaly from a starting folder).

**Note**: 
- The upload and download methods should support both files and folders. They should be able to handle small files abd large files as efficiently as possible. 
If it is recomended they should also do a hash check  so that files are not unnesserily uploaded and downloaded if they havent changed and to ensure that the file is 
not corrupted. The upload and download methods should also support progress bars. 
- The list and search method should return a list of files and folders in the specified folder or recersively list all files and folders in the specified 
folder and its subfolders. If necessary (for instance in large recursive listings) it should also have a progress bar. The list and search methods should also
support filtering by file type and file size and return a dataframe of the results.
- The move and copy methods should support moving and copying files and folders.
- The rename method should support renaming files and folders.
- The delete method should support deleting files and folders.

**NB**: 
- You should create the necessary classes and methods to support the above functionality and it should follow the best practices and be as efficient and performant as possible.
- You should also create a test suite to test the above functionality.
- You should also create all the necessary documentation for the above functionality. This should include a README.md file and a docstring for each class and method.
